# spamfreesearch

Domains that spam web search results with "mirrors" of GitHub/Stackoverflow answers and generated "tutorials" are annoying af.

Google used to provide a feature where you could exclude a list of domains from search results. Unfortunately they don't do that anymore, and more and more "archive" sites have started popping up, spamming the first page of results.

Maybe one day Google will bring it back... or maybe Bing will do it, and geeks everywhere will suddenly have a reason to want to use Bing...

But until that time: this is a quick Firefox add-on search provider, which appends "-site:" to the Google search query, preventing these spammy results from cluttering up the first page.
